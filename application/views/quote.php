				<em><P>"The ASSOCHAM has been closely working with the Ministry of MSME, Government of India endeavoring to create value for the Indian industry, business and trade since its inception in 1920.MSMEs are the best vehicle for inclusive growth to create local demand and consumption and also to fight with the global meltdown. Public policy has rightly accorded high priority to this sector in order to achieve balanced, sustainable more equitable and inclusive growth in the country. A micro enterprise of today will be a big enterprise of tomorrow and might well become a multinational enterprise eventually, if given the support in finance and capacity building."</P>
