            <div class="panel-body"> The Ministry of MSME, Government of India and SIDBI set up the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) with a view to facilitate flow of credit to the MSE sector without the need for collaterals/ third party guarantees. The main objective of the scheme is that the lender should give importance to project viability and secure the credit facility purely on the primary security of the assets financed.<br><br>

The Credit Guarantee scheme (CGS) seeks to reassure the lender that, in the event of an MSE unit, which availed collateral- free credit facilities, fails to discharge its liabilities to the lender, the Guarantee Trust would make good the loss incurred by the lender up to 85 per cent of the outstanding amount in default.<br><br>

The CGTMSE would provide cover for credit facility up to Rs. 100 lakh which have been extended by lending institutions without any collateral security and /or third party guarantees. A guarantee and annual service fee is charged by the CGTMSE to avail of the guarantee cover. Presently the guarantee fee and annual service charges are to be borne by the borrower.

The basic objective of this scheme is to encourage MSMEs in adopting energy efficient technologies and to improve product quality of manufacturing in MSMEs. It is a well known fact that energy consumption is a significant component in the cost structure of almost any manufacturing/ production activity. Adopting energy efficient technologies curtails the cost of energy there by reducing production cost and increasing competitiveness. Under this scheme, a capital subsidy of 25% of the project cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 10.00 lakh shall be provided to the registered MSME units. While 25% of the project cost will be provided as subsidy by the Government of India, the balance amount is to be funded through loan from SIDBI/banks/financial institutions. The minimum contribution as required by the funding agency will have to be made by the MSME unit.

The goal of this scheme is to help MSME manufacturing industries move up the value chain by switching the production mode from original equipment manufacturing to original design manufacturing and hence original brand manufacturing. In the Design Clinic scheme, the value additions to an idea or a concept are imparted through interaction at a lesser cost to a specific industry/sector.

In terms of the recommendations of the Prime Minister’s Task Force on MSMEs banks have been advised to achieve a 20 per cent year-on-year growth in credit to micro and small enterprises, a 10 per cent annual growth in the number of micro enterprise accounts and 60% of total lending to MSE sector as on preceding March 31st to Micro enterprises.<br><br>

In order to ensure that sufficient credit is available to micro enterprises within the MSE sector, banks should ensure that:<br><br>

40 per cent of the total advances to MSE sector should go to micro (manufacturing) enterprises having investment in plant and machinery up to Rs. 10 lakh and micro (service) enterprises having investment in equipment up to Rs. 4 lakh ; 20 per cent of the total advances to MSE sector should go to micro (manufacturing) enterprises with investment in plant and machinery above Rs. 10 lakh and up to Rs. 25 lakh, and micro (service) enterprises with investment in equipment above Rs. 4 lakh and up to Rs. 10 lakh. Thus, 60 per cent of MSE advances should go to the micro enterprises.<br>

A unit should be declared unviable only if the viability status is evidenced by a viability study. However, it may not be feasible to conduct viability study in very small units and will only increase paperwork. As such for micro (manufacturing) enterprises, having investment in plant and machinery up to Rs. 5 lakh and micro (service) enterprises having investment in equipment up to Rs. 2 lakh, the Branch Manager may take a decision on viability and record the same, along with the justification. The declaration of the unit as unviable, as evidenced by the viability study, should have the approval of the next higher authority/ present sanctioning authority for both micro and small units. In case such a unit is declared unviable, an opportunity should be given to the unit to present the case before the next higher authority. The modalities for presenting the case to the next higher authority may be worked out by the banks in terms of their Board approved policies in this regard The next higher authority should take such decision only after giving an opportunity to the promoters of the unit to present their case. For sick units declared unviable, with credit facilities of Rs. 1 crore and above, a Committee approach may be adopted. A Committee comprising of senior officials of the bank may examine such proposals. This is expected to improve the quality of decisions as collective wisdom of the members shall be utilized, especially while taking decision on rehabilitation proposals. The final decision should be communicated to the promoters in writing. The above process should be completed in a time bound manner and should not take more than 3 months. </div>
